# SCT_ML1
📌 Project Overview

Preprocess dataset and extract relevant features:

GrLivArea → Above grade living area (sqft)

BedroomAbvGr → Number of bedrooms above ground

FullBath → Number of full bathrooms

SalePrice → Target variable (house price)

Train-test split is performed to evaluate model performance.

The model is trained using Linear Regression and evaluated using:

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Prices using Matplotlib.

Interactive prediction: User can input area, bedrooms, and bathrooms to get a predicted house price
